# Save To Azure Blob Markdown Monster Add-in

This project provides a Markdown Monster Add-in for saving images opened from a file or from the clipboard and posting them to Azure Blob Storage. Images are previewed and can then be pushed to Azure Storage with the resulting URL automatically getting embedded into the open Markdown document.
